\description{
A data set of the EUNIS habitats. Each row is an habitat.

The EUNIS habitat classification is a comprehensive pan-European system for
habitat identification. The classification is hierarchical and covers all
types of habitats from natural to artificial, from terrestrial to freshwater
and marine. The habitat types are identified by specific codes, names and
descriptions and come with cross-walks to other habitat typologies.
See \code{\link[=crosswalk]{crosswalk()}} for mapping between habitat classification systems.

\subsection{EUNIS 2012}{

The full list of EUNIS habitats 2012: codes, scientific names and revised
descriptions. The habitat descriptions of the EUNIS classification 2007 were
revised in 2012. The 2007 habitat types were not changed in the 2012
description revision which mostly replaced Palaearctic or UK Marine habitat
classification codes used in habitat descriptions at levels 5 and below with
their EUNIS classification equivalents. In 2019 the classification was
further amended to include two new habitats of the revised Resolution 4 of
Bern Convention as adopted at the 38th Standing Committee meeting, November
2018. The two habitats are G3.4G Pinus sylvestris forest on chalk in the
steppe zone and X36 Depressions (pody) of the Steppe zone.

\subsection{EUNIS Marine 2019}{

A revision of EUNIS marine habitat classification was published in 2019. From
June 2021 the classification was complemented with crosswalks to Habitats
Directive Annex I and to European Red List of Habitats. An updated version
was published in March 2022. Users should change to the 2022 version at their
earliest convenience.
}

\subsection{EUNIS Marine 2022}{

The review of the marine component of the EUNIS habitat classification was
initiated in 2014. Marine benthic habitats, marine pelagic and marine ice
associated habitats are separated into three distinct groups, each with a
separate classification structure. The first major division in the benthic
marine part of the EUNIS classification is based on major biological zones
(related to depth) and substrate type. Level 3 of the classification reflects
the main biogeographical regions of Europeâ€™s seas based on their distinct
combinations of salinity and temperature regimes (Arctic, Baltic, Atlantic,
Mediterranean and Black Sea). A first review was published in 2019 and an
update to this version concerning mostly the Atlantic regional sea is
available since March 2022. Crosswalks to Habitats Directive Annex I and to
European Red List of Habitats are available while crosswalks to EUNIS marine
habitats of version 2012 for the regional seas apart from the Atlantic need
to be revisited.
}

\subsection{EUNIS Terrestrial 2021}{

The review of the terrestrial component of the EUNIS habitat classification
was initiated in 2015. The review concerns the groups of coastal habitats,
grasslands, heathland, forest, sparsely vegetated and vegetated man-made
habitats. The review was updated in January 2023 with some corrections to the
existing groups and with the inclusion of wetlands and additional crosslinks.
The remaining groups will be revised and published at a later stage. The
classification includes cross-walks at level 3 to Habitats Directive Annex I,
to European Red List of Habitats, to Bern Convention Resolution 4 habitats,
to MAES and IUCN ecosystems, to Corine Land Cover classes and to the Euroveg
Checklist 2016 Syntaxa. The groups of forest and heathland include also
crosswalks to an earlier revision of these groups published in 2017. Habitats
at level 3 are complemented with lists of characteristic species identified
from the EVA database.
